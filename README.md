# FIT3161

## Overview

Digitising the Assessment of Post-Traumatic Amnesia.

## Technology

The project is built on JavaScript with the [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) libraries. This provides a hybrid static and server-side rendered application. A good knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and Next.js is recommended to be a productive developer.

## Install

You must have the following pre-requisites installed:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

Then you must run the following commands:

```sh
# Download the git repository.
git clone git@github.com:scottwillmoore/fit3161.git

# Install all required dependencies.
npm install

# Run the development server.
npm run develop
```

You may now edit and tweak files and in most cases they will automatically hot-reload.

It is recommended that an editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used. It is highly recommended that you install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension and configure it as the [default formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode#default-formatter) for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and configure the editor to [format on save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode#format-on-save).
